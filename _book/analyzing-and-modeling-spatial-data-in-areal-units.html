<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Quantifying spatial autocorrelation</h2>
<p>“<strong>An awful lot of time I spend "coding" is actually spent copying and pasting (And much of the rest is spent googling).</strong>”— Meghan Duffy</p>
<p>In this lesson we will use functions from the {spdep} package (Roger Bivand et al.). Functions in this package provide tools analyzing and modeling data that are aggregated to polygons. This type of data is widely used in the social sciences including demography and epidemiology. Sometimes called lattice data.</p>
<div id="spatial-autocorrelation" class="section level3" number="5.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> Spatial autocorrelation</h3>
<p>The concept of spatial autocorrelation plays a central role in spatial statistics. How it gets estimated and exploited depends on the spatial geometry of the data. For example, Ripley’s K function estimates spatial autocorrelation of events as point geometries.
In the case of data aggregated to polygons (or raster cells) spatial autocorrelation measures the degree to which attribute values tend to cluster. Recall attributes are variables in a spatial data frame (either as a column in a simple feature object or as a layer in a raster object).</p>
<p>Temporal versus spatial autocorrelation</p>
<p>Spatial clustering arises from:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Association: whatever is causing an attribute to have a certain value in one area causes the attribute to have a similar value in areas nearby. Crime rates in nearby neighborhoods might tend to cluster due to similar factors such as economic status and the amount of policing. Non-infectious diseases (e.g., lung cancer) might have similar rates in neighborhoods close to an oil refinery.</p></li>
<li><p>Causality: something within a given area directly influences outcomes within nearby areas. The broken window theory of crime suggests that poverty, lack of maintenance, and petty crime tends to breed more crime due to a perceived breakdown in civil order.</p></li>
<li><p>Interaction: the movement of people, goods or information creates relationships between areas. Infectious diseases might spread from a source region thus increasing the disease rates in surrounding areas as the direct result of contact or movement of people between regions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Spatial statistics can quantify, and condition on, spatial autocorrelation but are silent about physical causes. Understanding the reason for spatial autocorrelation is important for causal inference because the causal mechanism might be confounded (statistically) by it. Divorce rates are high in states in the South but so is the number of Waffle Houses.</p>
<p>Understanding causation requires domain specific knowledge.</p>

<div id="quantifying-spatial-autocorrelation-1" class="section level3" number="5.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2</span> Quantifying spatial autocorrelation</h3>
<p>When variables are spatially aggregated to regions, autocorrelation is quantified by calculating how similar a value in region <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is to the value in region <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and weighting this similarity by how ‘close’ region <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is to region <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. Closer regions have greater weight.</p>
<p>High similarities with high weight (similar values close together) yield high values of spatial autocorrelation. Low similarities with high weight (dissimilar values close together) yield low values of spatial autocorrelation.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\hbox{sim}_{ij}\)</span> denote the similarity between values <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_j\)</span>, and let <span class="math inline">\(w_{ij}\)</span> denote a weight describing the ‘distance’ between regions <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, for <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> = 1, …, <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then a spatial autocorrelation index (SAI) is given by
<span class="math display">\[
\hbox{SAI} = \frac{\sum_{i,j=1}^N w_{ij}\hbox{sim}_{ij}}{\sum_{i,j=1}^N w_{ij}}
\]</span>
which represents the weighted similarity between regions. The collection of weights is called a spatial weights matrix. The spatial weights matrix defines the neighbors for each region and their strength of association.</p>
<p>For cells in a raster under the rook-contiguity criterion, <span class="math inline">\(w_{ij}\)</span> = 1 if cell <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> share a boundary, and 0 otherwise. In this case <span class="math inline">\(w_{ij}\)</span> = <span class="math inline">\(w_{ji}\)</span>. Also a cell is not a neighbor to itself so <span class="math inline">\(w_{ii}\)</span> = 0.</p>
<p>As an alternative we can define center locations from a set of polygon regions and let <span class="math inline">\(w_{ij}\)</span> = 1 if the center of region <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is near the center of region <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and 0 otherwise. In this case we need to decide on the number of nearest neighbors.</p>
<p>We can also define neighbors by distance. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(d_{ij}\)</span> is the distance between centers <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, we can let <span class="math inline">\(w_{ij}\)</span> = 1 if <span class="math inline">\(d_{ij}\)</span> &lt; <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> and 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>The <code>nb</code> in the <code>poly2nb()</code> function names stands for neighbor list object. The function builds the list from regions based on contiguity. Neighbors must share one or more geometry points. By default the contiguity is defined as having at least one point in common. This is changed by using the argument <code>queen = FALSE</code>.</p>
<p>There are 49 tracts (polygons). Each tract is bordered by at least one other tract (each tract is bordered by at least one tract). The average number of neighbors is 4.8. The total number of neighbors over all tracts is 236. This represents 9.8% of all possible connections (if every tract is a neighbor of itself and every other tract 49 * 49).</p>
<p>A graph of the neighbor links is obtained with the <code>plot()</code> method. The arguments include the neighbor list object (<code>nbs</code>) and the location of the polygon centers, which are extracted from the simple feature data frame using the <code>st_centroid()</code>.</p>

<span class="math display">\[
\hbox{sim}_{ij} \propto (Y_i - \bar Y) (Y_j - \bar Y)

<p>The I value of -3.5 indicates that the center cell which has a value below the average over all 25 cells is mostly surrounded by cells having values above the average.</p>
<p>Repeat this calculation for every cell and then take the sum.</p>
<p>This is what the function <code>moran()</code> from the {spdep} package does. The first argument is the vector containing the values for which we are interested in determining the magnitude of the spatial autocorrelation and the second argument is the <code>listw</code> object.</p>
<p>Further, we need to specify the number of regions and the sum of the weights <code>S0</code>. The latter is obtained from the <code>Szero()</code> function applied to the <code>listw</code> object.</p>
<p>Returning to the Columbus crime data here we let <code>m</code> be the number of census tracts and <code>s</code> be the sum of the weights. We then apply the <code>moran()</code> function on the variable <code>CRIME</code> in</p>

<p>The function returns the Moran’s I statistic and the kurtosis (K) of the distribution of crime values. Moran’s I ranges from -1 to +1. The value of .5 for the crime rates indicates fairly high spatial autocorrelation. This is expected based on the clustering of crime in the central city. Positive values of Moran’s I indicate clustering and negative values indicate inhibition.</p>
<p>Kurtosis is a statistic measuring the peakedness of the distribution of the attribute values. A normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3. If the kurtosis is too large (or small) relative to a normal distribution then the inferences we make with Moran’s I are suspect.</p>
<p>Q: Which of the two variables (<code>INC</code> or <code>HOVAL</code>) shows the most clustering?</p>
<p>Another index of spatial autocorrelation is the Geary’s C statistic. The equation is
<span class="math display">\[
\hbox{C} = \frac{(N-1) \sum_{i,j} w_{ij} (Y_i-Y_j)^2}{2 W \sum_{i}(Y_i-\bar Y)^2} 
\]</span>
where again <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is the sum over all weights (<span class="math inline">\(w_{ij}\)</span>) and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the number of areas.</p>
<p>The syntax of the <code>geary()</code> function is similar to the syntax of the <code>moran()</code> function except we also specify <code>n1</code> to be one minus the number of polygons.</p>

<p>Values for Geary’s C range from 0 to 2 with 1 indicating no spatial autocorrelation. Values less than 1 indicate positive autocorrelation. Both I and C are global measures of autocorrelation, but C is more sensitive to local variations in autocorrelation.</p>
<p>Rule of thumb: If the interpretation of Geary’s C is much different than the interpretation of Moran’s I then consider computing local measures of spatial autocorrelation.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.7</span> Spatial lag</h3>
<p>Moran’s I is the slope coefficient from a regression of the weighted average of the neighborhood values onto the observed values. The weighted average of neighborhood values is called the spatial lag.</p>
<p>Let <code>crime</code> be the set of crime values in each region. We create a spatial lag variable using the <code>lag.listw()</code> function. The first argument is the <code>listw</code> object and the second is the vector of crime values.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Statistical significance of spatial autocorrelation</h2>
<p>Even in a random pattern of attribute values across a spatial domain the value of <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> will almost certainly be non-zero. If we want to use <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> to establish clustering we need a way to guard against being fooled by this randomness.</p>
<p>Is the value of Moran’s I significant with respect to the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation? One way to answer this question is to draw an uncertainty band on the regression line and see if a horizontal line can be placed within the band. If not, then I is statistically different than what we would expect if the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation were true.</p>
<p>More formally the question is answered by comparing the standard deviate (<span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> value) of the I statistic with a standard normal deviate. This is done using the <code>moran.test()</code> function, where the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> value is the difference between I and the expected value of I divided by the square root of the variance of I.</p>
<p>The function takes a variable name or numeric vector and a spatial weights list object in that order. The argument <code>randomisation = FALSE</code> means the variance of I is computed under the assumption of normally distributed SIDS rates.</p>

<p>The SIDS rates are more “peaked” (higher kurtosis) than a normal distribution. In this case it is better to use the default <code>randomisation = TRUE</code> argument.</p>
<p>Further, the assumptions underlying Moran’s test are sensitive to the form of the graph of neighbour relationships and other factors so results should be checked against a test that involves permutations.</p>

<div id="monte-carlo-approach-to-inference" class="section level3" number="5.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.1</span> Monte Carlo approach to inference</h3>
<p>A permutation test for Moran’s I is performed with the <code>moran.mc()</code> function. MC stands for Monte Carlo which refers to the city of Monte Carlo in Monaco famous for its gambling casinos. The MC procedure refers to random sampling.</p>
<p>The name of the data vector and the weights list object (<code>listw</code>) are required arguments as is the number of permutations (<code>nsim</code>). Each permutation is a random rearrangement of the SIDS rates across the counties. This removes the spatial autocorrelation but keeps the non-spatial distribution of the SIDS rates. The neighbor topology and weights remain the same.</p>
<p>For each permutation (random shuffle), I is computed and saved. The <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value is obtained as the ratio of the number of permuted I values greater or exceeding the observed I over the number of permutation plus one. In the case where there are 5 permuted I values greater or equal to the observed value based on 99 simulations, the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value is 5/(99 + 1) = .05.</p>

<p>The density curve is centered just to the left of zero consistent with the theoretical expectation (mean) of -.01. Also note that the right tail is fatter than the left tail. This is due to the skewness of the rates used in the calculation of I.</p>
<p>What do you do with the knowledge that the SIDS rates have significant spatial autocorrelation? By itself not much but it can provide notice that something might be going on in certain regions (hot spot analysis).</p>
<p>More typically the knowledge is useful after other known factors are considered. Or in the language of statistics, knowledge of significant spatial autocorrelation in the model residuals can help you build a better model.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.2</span> Spatial autocorrelation in model residuals</h3>
<p>A spatial regression model may be needed whenever the residuals from a non-spatial regression model exhibit significant spatial autocorrelation. So a common way to proceed is to first regress the response variable onto the explanatory variables and check for spatial autocorrelation.</p>
<p>Even if the response variable indicates a high level of spatial autocorrelation it might not be necessary to use a spatial regression model if the explanatory variables remove this correlation.</p>
<p>Let’s return to the Columbus crime data and fit a linear regression model with <code>CRIME</code> as the response variable and <code>INC</code> and <code>HOVAL</code> as the explanatory variables.</p>

<p>Yes. There are clustered regions where the model over predicts crime conditional on household income and housing values and where it under predicts crime.</p>
<p>The amount of clustering is less than before. That is, after accounting for regional factors related to crime the spatial autocorrelation is reduced.</p>

<p>Moran’s I on the model residuals is .222. This compares with the value of .5 on crime alone. Part of the spatial autocorrelation is absorbed by the explanatory factors.</p>
<p>Do we need a spatial regression model? The output gives a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value on I of .002, thus we reject the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation in the residuals and conclude that a spatial regression model would improve the fit.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-value takes into account the fact that these are residuals so the variance is adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>Values of Geary’s c are between 0 and 2 with values less than one indicating positive autocorrelation. If the interpretation on the amount of spatial autocorrelation based on Geary’s c is different than the interperation on the amount of autocorrelation based on Moran’s I then it might be a good idea to examine local variations in autocorrelation.</p>
<p>Finally, recall that to create a Moran’s scatter plot. We first assign to <code>white</code> the percentage of whites in each county (variable <code>WHITE</code>) and to <code>Wwhite</code> the spatial lagged value of percentage of whites. We then use <code>ggplot()</code> as follows.</p>

<p>We can also use the <code>moran.mc()</code> function as a non-parametric test for significance. It computes Moran’s I for each resampling of the data allowing your to establish the rank of the observed statistic in relation to the statistic computed on the samples. The data are resampled by randomly shuffling them across the geometric features. The distribution of the Moran’s I computed on the resampled data is a way to visualize the null hypothesis.</p>

<p>The Lee statistic [Lee (2001). Developing a bivariate spatial association measure: An integration of Pearson’s r and Moran’s I. J Geograph Syst 3: 369-385.] integrates the Pearson’s r as an aspatial bivariate association metric and Moran’s I as a univariate spatial autocorrelation metric. The formula is
<span class="math display">\[
L(x,y) = \frac{n}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\sum_{j=1}^{n}w_{ij})^2}
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\sum_{j=1}^{n}w_{ij}(x_i-\bar{x})) ((\sum_{j=1}^{n}w_{ij}(y_j-\bar{y}))}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
\]</span></p>
<p>The formula is implemented in the <code>lee()</code> function where the first two arguments are the variables of interest and we need to include the weights matrix and the number of regions. The output from this function is a list of two with the first being the value of Lee’s statistic (<code>L</code>).</p>

<p><strong>"When I’m explaining some of the tidy verse principles and philosophy in R statistics, I often break down a home baked chunk of code and illustrate that ‘it says what it does and it does what it says.’</strong> — Diane Beldame</p>
<p>The Moran’s I statistic was first used in the 1950s. Localization of this statistic was presented by Luc Anselin in 1995 (Anselin, L. 1995. Local indicators of spatial association, Geographical Analysis, 27, 93–115).</p>
<p>We saw the <code>raster::MoranLocal()</code> function will compute local Moran’s I on rasters and return a raster.</p>
<p>Local I is a deconstruction of global I where geographic proximity is used in two ways. (1) to define and weight neighbors and (2) to determine the spatial scale over which I is computed. Illustrate on the board.</p>
<p>Using queen’s contiguity we determined the neighborhood topology and the weights for the police expenditure data from Mississippi. Here we print them in the full matrix form with the <code>list2mat()</code> function.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> Spatial autocorrelation in model residuals</h3>
<p>The knowledge of significant spatial autocorrelation by itself is not typically useful. But knowledge of significant spatial autocorrelation in the residuals from some statistical model can help us build a more precise model.</p>
<p>A spatial regression model may be needed whenever the residuals resulting from a aspatial regression model exhibit significant spatial autocorrelation. So a common way to proceed is to first regress the response variable onto the explanatory variables and check for spatial autocorrelation in the residuals.</p>
<p>If the explanatory variables remove the spatial autocorrelation then a spatial regression model is not needed.</p>
<p>Let’s return to the Columbus crime data and fit a linear regression model with <code>CRIME</code> as the response variable and <code>INC</code> and <code>HOVAL</code> as the explanatory variables.</p>
<p>Import the data.</p>

<p>There are 49 residuals one for every census tract. A residual is defined as the difference between the observed value and the model predicted value. In this case a positive residual indicates that there is more crime than predicted by the model.</p>

<p>There appears to be clustered regions where the model over predicts crime (yellow to green tracts) conditional on household income and housing values and where it under predicts crime (yellow to red tracts).</p>
<p>The amount of clustering appears to be is less than before. That is, after accounting for regional factors related to crime the spatial autocorrelation is reduced.</p>

<p>Moran’s I on the model residuals is .222. This compares with the value of .5 on crime alone. Part of the spatial autocorrelation is absorbed by the explanatory factors.</p>
<p>Do we need a spatial regression model? The output gives a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value on I of .002, thus we reject the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation in the residuals and conclude that a spatial regression model would improve the fit.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-value takes into account the fact that these are residuals so the variance is adjusted accordingly.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Geographic regression</h2>
<p>If the residuals from a statistical model have significant autocorrelation then a spatial modeling approach is called for. One approach is to assume that the relationships between the response variable and the explanatory variables are modified by contextual factors.</p>
<p>Like with local variants of spatial autocorrelation metrics, which use only neighbors for estimates, we can fit separate regression models for each polygon using only values in neighborhoods. This approach is useful for exploratory analysis (e.g., to show where the explanatory variables are most strongly related to the response variable). This approach is called geographically weighted regression (GWR) or geographic regression.</p>
<p>GWR fits a separate regression model for every location in the dataset. Thus it is not a single model but rather a procedure for fitting a set of models. It fits the models by using the response and explanatory variables only from locations that fall within some prescribed distance (bandwidth). The bandwidth is pre-specified or determined by a cross-validation procedure. GWR is used in epidemiology, particularly for research on infectious diseases and for evaluating health policies or health programs.</p>
<p>Let’s see how GWR works with an example.</p>

<p>The single term delection table shows that when marriage age (<code>MA90</code>) is removed from the model the RSS (residual sum of squares) value increases by 35.2 units. This increase is not sufficient to justify the loss in the degrees of freedom by keeping it in the model. This is seen by an AIC value that is lower (4998.7) than the AIC when all terms are retained (4999.7) (see the row labeled <code>&lt;none&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>Recall: The AIC is a way to balance the tradeoff between bias and variance. Choose a model that has the lowest AIC. A model may have too much bias (toward the particular dataset) if it has too many parameters and a model may have too much residual variance if there are too few parameters.</p>
<p>We therefore remove marriage age and refit the mode.</p>

<p>Since the homicide rates are non-negative, transforming them to logarithms is a good idea.</p>
<p>We create a new column in the <code>homicides.sf</code> data from called <code>logHR90</code>. Since there are some counties with no homicides we change that to the minimum observed value before taking logarithms. Here we first create a logical vector <code>x</code> corresponding to the rows with non-zero homicide rates. We then find the minimum non-zero rate and assign it to <code>e</code>. Next we subset on this value for all rates equal to zero and finally we create a new column as the logarithm of the non-zero rates.</p>

<p>The range of predicted values is much better.</p>
<p>It is likely that homicide rates are similiar in neighboring counties. It also might be the case that the similarity is statistically explained by the variables in the model.</p>
<p>So our next step it to test for significant autocorrelation in the model residuals. We create a weights matrix using the functions from the {spdep} package and then use the <code>lm.morantest()</code> function.</p>

<p>There are small clusters of counties with positive residuals and other small clusters of negative residuals. Interestingly the pattern of these clusters appears to be different over western and northern areas compared to the deep South.</p>
<p>This suggests that the <em>relationships</em> between homicide rates and the socioeconomic factors might vary across the domain. GWR is a procedure to fit local regression models.</p>
<p>Linear regression is a model for the conditional mean. The mean of the response variable depends on the explanatory variable(s). Geographic regression might show how this dependency varies by location. It is an exploratory technique intended to indicate where local regression coefficients are different from the global values.</p>
<p>A model is fit at each location. All observations contribute to the fit but they are weighted inversely by their distance to the location. At the shortest distances observations are given the largest weights based on a Gaussian function. The process results in a set of regression coefficients for each observation.</p>
<p>We do this with functions from the {spgwr} package. The geometry information in simple feature data frames is not accessible by functions in this package so we need to create a new S4 spatial data frame.</p>

<p>The spatial information in the <code>SH.sp</code> is separated from the data frame (attribute table) but accessible by the functions <code>gwr.sel()</code> and <code>gwr()</code>. The variables remain the same.</p>

<p>The automatic selection procedure makes an initial guess at the bandwidth distance then fits local regression models in each county using neighbors defined by that distance. A cross-validated (CV) skill score is computed as the root mean square prediction error. The cross-validation procedures successively removes one county from the modeling and that county’s homicide rate is predicted. Each county takes turn getting removed.</p>
<p>The selection procedure continues by changing the initial guess at the bandwidth and computing the CV score. If the CV score is higher than wih the initial guess the bandwidth is changed in the other direction. If it is lower than the bandwidth is changed in the same direction. The entire procedure continues until no additional improvement is made to the CV score. This results in a minimum bandwith distance. In this case it is 165.5 km.</p>
<p>The bandwidth is assigned to the object <code>bw</code> as a single value.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we cannot use neighborhoods defined by contiquity. But to get a sense of what this bandwidth distance means in terms of the average number of neighbors per county we note that one-half the distance squared times pi is the area captured by the bandwidth.</p>

<p>The geographic regressions similarly capture the spatial pattern of homicides across the south. The spread of predicted values matches the observed spread better than the linear model. The pattern is also a smoother.</p>

<p>When we use a regression model to fit data that vary spatially we are assuming an underlying stationary process. This means we believe the explanatory variables ‘provoke’ the same statistical response across the entire domain. If this is not the case then it shows up in a map of correlated residuals. One approach to investigate things further is to use geographic regression. Another approach is to use a single spatial regression model.</p>
</div>

<div id="spatial-regression" class="section level2" number="5.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Spatial regression</h2>
<p>Ordinary regression models fit to spatially aggregated data can lead to improper inference because observations are not independent. Thus it’s necessary to check the residuals from an aspatial model for spatial autocorrelation. If the residuals are strongly correlated the model is misspecified.</p>
<p>In this case we can try to improve the model by adding variables. If that’s not possible (no additional data, or no clue as to what variable to include), we can try a spatial regression model. Spatial regression models are widely used in econometrics and epidemiology.</p>
<div id="spatial-lag-model-and-spatial-error-models" class="section level3" number="5.5.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.5.1</span> Spatial lag model and spatial error models</h3>
<p>The equation for a regression model in vector notation is
<span class="math display">\[
y = X \beta + \varepsilon
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(n \times 1\)</span> vector of response variable values, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(p+1\)</span> matrix containing the explanatory variables and augmented by a column of ones for the intercept term, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(p+1\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> 1 vector of model coefficients and <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(n \times 1\)</span> vector of residuals (iid).</p>
<p>Two options exist if the elements of the vector <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span> are spatially correlated. The first is to rewrite the model adding a spatial lag term as
<span class="math display">\[
y = \rho W y + X \beta + \varepsilon
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(Wy\)</span> is the weighted average of the neighborhood response values with <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> the spatial weights matrix, and <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is the autoregression coefficient. This is called a spatial autoregressive (SAR) model.</p>
<p>Note: <span class="math inline">\(Wy\)</span> is the spatial lag variable we compute with the <code>lag.listw()</code> function and <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is Moran’s I. Thus the model is also called a spatial lag model (SLM).</p>
<p>Justification for the spatial lag model is motivated by a diffusion process. The response variable <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> is influenced by the explanatory variables at location <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and by explanatory variables at locations <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rho Wy\)</span> is called the spatial signal term and <span class="math inline">\(\beta X\)</span> is called the trend term.</p>
<p>The second option is to rewrite the model by adding a spatial error term as
<span class="math display">\[
y = X\beta + \lambda W \epsilon + u
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is the autoregression coefficient, <span class="math inline">\(W\epsilon\)</span> is the spatial error term representing the weighted average of the neighborhood residuals, and <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> are the overall residuals assumed to be iid. This is called a spatial error model (SEM).</p>
<p>Here the lag term is computed using the residuals rather the response variable.</p>
<p>Application of the spatial error model is motivated by the omitted variable bias. Suppose the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is statistically described by two variables <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> each centered on zero and independent. Then
<span class="math display">\[
y = \beta x + \theta z
\]</span>
If <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is not observed, the vector <span class="math inline">\(\theta z\)</span> is nested in the error term <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>.
<span class="math display">\[
y = \beta x + \epsilon
\]</span></p>
<p>Examples of an unobserved latent variable <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> include local culture, social capital, neighborhood readiness. Importantly we would expect the latent variable to be spatially correlated (e.g., culture will be similar across neighborhoods), so let
<span class="math display">\[
z = \lambda W z + r\\
z = (I - \lambda W)^{-1} r
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is a vector of random independent residuals (e.g., culture is similar but not identical), <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is the spatial weights matrix and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is a scalar spatial correlation parameter. Substituting into the equation above
<span class="math display">\[
y = \beta x + \theta z \\
y = \beta x +   \theta (I - \lambda W)^{-1} r\\
y = \beta x + (I - \lambda W)^{-1} \varepsilon
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon = \theta r\)</span>.</p>
<p>Another reason for fitting a spatial error model is spatial heterogeneity. Suppose we have multiple observations for each unit. If we want our model to incorporate individual effects we can include a <span class="math inline">\(n \times 1\)</span> vector <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> of individual intercepts for each unit.
<span class="math display">\[
y = a + X\beta
\]</span>
where now <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> matrix.</p>
<p>In a cross-sectional setting with one observation per unit (typically the case in observational studies), this approach is not possible since we will have more parameters than observations.</p>
<p>Instead we can treat <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> as a vector of spatial random effects. We assume that the intercepts follows a spatially smoothed process
<span class="math display">\[
a = \lambda W a + \epsilon \\
a = (I - \lambda W)^{-1} \epsilon
\]</span>
which leads to the previous model
<span class="math display">\[
y = X\beta + (I - \lambda W)^{-1} \epsilon
\]</span></p>

<p>Let’s see how to choose between these two options with an example.

Further we first need to check whether a spatial regression model is warranted by testing whether there is significant spatial autocorrelation in the residuals of the aspatial model.</p>

<p>The answer is ‘yes’ a spatial regression model is warranted.</p>
<p>To help decide between the two spatial regression models described above we run a sequence of statistical tests on our linear model object. The tests are the Lagrange multiplier (LM) tests. LM refers to a technique to determine the coefficients on the explanatory variables while simultaneously determining the coefficient on the spatial regression term. It does this iteratively.</p>
<p>The tests are performed with the <code>lm.LMtests()</code> function. The test type is specified as a character string. The tests should be considered in order. Start with the standard version of both the spatial error model and spatial lag model LM tests.</p>
<p>For example, to perform a LM test for the spatial error and spatial lag model on the Columbus crime model we type</p>

<p>The output shows that both the spatial error and spatial lag model terms are significant (<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value &lt; .15). Ideally one term is significant and the other is not and we choose the model with the significant term.</p>
<p>Since both are significant we should test again. This time we use the robust forms of the statistics.</p>

<p>Here the error model has a large <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value and the lag model has a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value that is less than .15 so we choose the lag model for our spatial regression.</p>

<p>Let’s break down the output starting with the coefficients.</p>
<div id="interpreting-the-model-coefficients" class="section level4" number="5.5.3.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.5.3.1</span> Interpreting the model coefficients</h4>
<p>The first batch of output concerns the model residuals and the coefficients on the explanatory variables. The model residuals are the observed crime rates minus the predicted crime rates.</p>
<p>The coefficients on income and housing have the same sign (negative) and they remain statistically significant.</p>
<p>The spatial lag model allows for ‘spillover’. That is a change in an explantory variable anywhere in the study domain will affect the value of the response variable everywhere. Spillover occurs even when the neighborhood weights matrix represents simple (1st-order) local contiguity. The spillover makes interpreting the marginal effects more complicated.</p>
<p>The spatial lag model implies that for a change in the value of an explanatory variable there are direct and indirect effects on the response variable.</p>
<p>For example, the direct effect gives the impact a change in income has on crime averaged over all tracts. It takes into account the effects that occur from a change in the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th tract’s income on crime across neighboring tracts.</p>
<p>The indirect effect gives the impact of a change in income has on crime averaged over all OTHER tracts. The indirect effect represent spillovers. The influences on the dependent variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in a region rendered by change in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in some other region. For example, if all tracts <span class="math inline">\(i \ne j\)</span> (i not equal to j) increase their income, what will be the impact on crime in region <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>?</p>
<p>The total effect (TE) is the sum of the direct and indirect effects. It measures the total cumulative impact on crime arising from one tract <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> increasing its income over all other tracts (on average). It is given by
<span class="math display">\[
\hbox{TE} = \left(\frac{\beta_k}{1-\rho^2}\right)\left(1 + \rho\right)

where <span class="math inline">\(\beta_k\)</span> is the marginal effect of variable <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is the spatial autocorrelation. With <span class="math inline">\(\rho = 0\)</span> TE is <span class="math inline">\(\beta_k\)</span>.</p>

<p>The direct effects are the changes in the response variable of a particular region arising from a one unit increase in an explanatory variable in that region.</p>
<p>The indirect effects are the changes in the response variable of a particular region arising from a one unit increase in an explanatory variable in another region. For example, due to spatial autocorrelation, a one-unit change in the income variable in region 1 affects the crime rate in regions 2 and 3.</p>

<p>The next set of output is about the estimate of spatial autocorrelation (<span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>). The value is .4233 and a likelihood ratio test gives a value of 9.41 which translates to a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value of .002. The null hypothesis is the autocorrelation is zero, so we confidently reject it. This is consistent with the significant Moran’s I value that we found in the linear model residuals.</p>
<p>Two other tests are performed on the value of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> including a z-test (t-test) using the asymptotic standard error and a Wald test. Both tests confirm that the lag term should be included in the model.</p>

<p>Here we find the spatial autoregression (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>) is significant, but the log likelihood value from the model is smaller (-183.7) and the AIC value is larger (377.5) compared with corresponding values from the lag model. This is consistent with the LM tests indicating the spatial lag model is more appropriate.</p>
<p>We compare the log likelihoods from the two spatial regression models and find that the lag model is a good improvement over the error model. This result is consistent with our above decision to use the lag model.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.5.4</span> Predictions</h3>
<p>The <code>predict()</code> method implements the <code>predict.sarlm()</code> function to calculate predictions from the spatial regression model. The prediction is decomposed into a “trend” term (explanatory variable effect) and a “signal” term (spatial smoother). The predicted fit is the sum of the trend and the signal terms when using the spatial lag model.</p>
<p>We make predictions with the <code>predict()</code> method under the assumption that the mean response is known. We examine the structure of the corresponding predict object.</p>

<p>We will analyze these data at the county level. In Lesson 6 we saw how to aggregate variables in a spatial data frame using functions in the <strong>areal</strong> package. This allows for greater flexibility since the aggregating units do not need to be in alignment.</p>
<p>Since the California tracts are completely contained within county boundaries (aligned) here we use the <code>aggregate()</code> function from the <strong>raster</strong> package.</p>
<p>We have county names (<code>County</code>) as a character variable so we can aggregate by name after converting the simple feature to an S4 class spatial data frame.</p>

<p>We need to aggregate the variables to the county level. Although it is possible to do everything in one step with <code>aggregate()</code> it is best to be careful because how we want a variable aggregated depends on its type (extensive or intensive).</p>
<p>The simplest case is where we can sum the values (extensive variables like the number of houses). First create a simple feature data frame and select a subset of the columns.</p>

<p>The result is a spatial data frame containing county-level totals aggregated from the original tract-level data.</p>
<p>In other cases like with home values we need to use a weighted average to take into account the fact that housing values may be high in a small tract in a county but they may be much lower in a larger tract in the same county (intensive variable). So here we create average values per household in three steps.</p>

<p>According to the model, <code>yearBuilt</code> is highly significant. Older houses are more valuable. House values increase by 13K dollars for every additional year of existence. The number of bedrooms is also marginally significant. Every bedroom adds about 192K dollars to the value of a house.</p>

<p>The model under predicts house values in San Francisco by over $100K.</p>
<p>Next, examine the model residuals for spatial autocorrelation. We first compute the neighborhood topology based on contiguity. But then add two links: between San Francisco and Marin County and vice versa (to consider the fact that the Golden Gate bridge connects these two counties in a way that would likely influence housing prices).</p>
<p>This is done by knowing the row numbers of these two counties and adding these numbers to the neighborhood list object. Note that since county 21 is a neighbor of county 38, county 38 must be a neighbor of county 21 so we need to adjust both.</p>

<p>Or we can use nearest neighbors. Start by extracting the coordinates of each county using the <code>st_coordinates()</code> function after applying the <code>st_centroid()</code> function.

<p>The results from the LM tests do not help us discern between and a lag and an error model. However, the results from the RLM tests favor of a lag model. Recall the lag model includes a spatial lag term on the response variable.</p>
<p>This same decision is reached when using the nearest neighbor weights (<code>kwt</code>).</p>
<p>Fit the model. Here we need to specify a lower tolerance for numerically solving the inverse of the covariance matrix. This is needed in this case because the explanatory variables have very different scales. Actually it might be better to scale the variables first.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.6</span> Bayesian spatial regression using INLA</h2>
<p>See for updates to notes below: <a href="https://github.com/becarioprecario/INLAMSM" class="uri">https://github.com/becarioprecario/INLAMSM</a></p>
<p>Interest in spatial statistical models has increased substantially in the recent years stemming in part from the availability of methods to fit them. One such method is called Bayesian inference.</p>
<p>Classical statistics relies on the likelihood function (<span class="math inline">\(p(y|\theta)\)</span>) which specifies the probability distribution of our data (<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>) under a model defined by parameters (<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>). Recall that we compared our spatial models using values of the log likelihood.</p>
<p>Variability on <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> comes about from sampling. That is we assume that the data are a random sample from a study population and the uncertainty arises because we only observe a single sample instead of the entire population.</p>
<p>But with Bayesian inference, the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> are unknown quantities modeled through a suitable <em>prior</em> probability distribution <span class="math inline">\(p(\theta)\)</span> before we observing any sample <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. The prior probability distribution reflects our prior belief about <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. Then given the likelihood and the prior the inferential problem is solved using Bayes theorem. That is, we want to know the probability of our model being true given our sample of data <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> (the posterior distribution).
<span class="math display">\[
p(\theta|y) = \frac{p(y|\theta) \times p(\theta)}{p(y)}
\]</span></p>
<p>Determining the posterior distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> given our data requires determining <span class="math inline">\(p(y)\)</span> (marginal distribution of our data). This can only be done analytically for a relatively small set of all models (those involving conjugate distributions), none of which are spatial.</p>
<p>Bayesian models for spatial data started appearing around 2000 with the development of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure (Gilks et al. 1996). This allowed researchers to implement realistic models (involving fewer simplifying assumptions). A main contribution to spatial models at this time came with the development of the conditional autoregressive (CAR) representation for specifying spatial autocorrelation (Besag et al. 1991).</p>
<p>MCMC methods are now routinely used in Bayesian inference, but they are limited by the need for alot of processing power. To overcome this Rue et al. (2009) developed a technique called integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) that estimates the posterior marginals (not the joint posterior) for models that have an underlying (latent) Gaussian structure.</p>
<p>Latent Gaussian fields appear in a fair number of spatial models. This means that INLA is useful for fitting more complex spatial regression models when only marginal inference on the model parameters is needed.</p>
<div id="the-inla-package" class="section level3" number="5.6.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.1</span> The {INLA} package</h3>
<p>The {INLA} package (Rue et al. 2014) provides an interface to the free-standing INLA program so models can be fit using standard R commands. The package is available from <a href="http://www.r-inla.org/" class="uri">http://www.r-inla.org/</a>. The model interface is similar to the one used to fit generalized additive models (GAM) with the <code>gam()</code> function from the {mgcv} package.</p>
<p>The <code>formula</code> argument can handle fixed effects, nonlinear terms, and random effects. The interface allows for the specification of various priors and model fitting options. Nonlinear and random effects are included in the formula as calls to the <code>f()</code> function. Spatial dependence is included as part of a vector of latent effects.</p>
<p>The package includes a model for uncorrelated random effects <span class="math inline">\(u_i\)</span> in aggregated data.
<span class="math display">\[
u_i \sim N(0, \tau_u)
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\tau_u\)</span> refers to the precision (inverse of the variance) of the Gaussian distribution. The {INLA} package assigns a prior to <span class="math inline">\(\log(\tau_u)\)</span> which, by default, is a log-gamma distribution.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen in order to model spatial correlation neighborhoods must be defined.</p>
<p>Spatial autocorrelation is modeled using a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and a precision matrix that specifies the correlation between neighbors. Given that these latent effects (unobserved) are Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRF), we can define the variance-covariance matrix of the random effects as:
<span class="math display">\[
\Sigma = \frac{1}{\tau} Q^{-1}
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is a precision parameter and <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> encodes the spatial structure as a matrix. Given the assumption of a latent GMRF, the matrix <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is defined such that <span class="math inline">\(Q_{ij}\)</span> is zero if areas <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> are not neighbors. This means <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is sparse.</p>
<p>One way to specify spatial dependence is through the conditional autoregressive (CAR) representation. This produces a <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> matrix in which element <span class="math inline">\(Q_{ii}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(n_i\)</span> (the number of neighbors of area <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>) and elements <span class="math inline">\(Q_{ij}\)</span> (with <span class="math inline">\(i \ne j\)</span>) are one if areas <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> are neighbors and zero otherwise.</p>
<p>This specification implies that the spatial random effects <span class="math inline">\(v_i\)</span> are distributed as normal with mean equal to the neighborhood average and variance scaled by the number of neighbors.
<span class="math display">\[
v_i|v_j, \tau_v \sim N\left( \frac{1}{n_i} \sum_{i \sim j} v_j, \frac{1}{\tau_v n_i} \right) \hspace{.5cm} i \ne j
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\tau_v\)</span> is the conditional precision of the random effects. Again, {INLA} uses a log-gamma prior on log(<span class="math inline">\(\tau_v\)</span>).</p>

<p>The model in matrix notation can be expressed as
<span class="math display">\[
y = X \beta + v + u
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is a vector of coefficients for the explanatory variables (and intercept), <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is the spatial random effect with a CAR specification, and <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is a random Gaussian error term. Note the similarity with the spatial lab model from Lesson 11.</p>
<p>The explanatory effects (including the intercept) are given Gaussian priors with mean of zero and precision of .01 by default. These can be changed through the <code>control.fixed()</code> function.</p>
<p>With Bayesian models it is advisable to center and scale the variables. Scaled variables make it is easier to determine prior distributions and, when using MCMC approaches, reasonable initial starting locations are easier to find. Here we use the <code>scale()</code> function that subtracts the mean and divides by the standard deviation.</p>

<p>We already specified the explanatory effects (trend) part of the model. Here we repeat using the scaled variables. Then we add the intrinsic CAR specification by using the <code>f()</code> function with arguments <code>model = 'besag'</code> and <code>graph = wtsF</code>.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.3</span> Bayesian spatial regression using Stan</h3>
<p>Stan is a probabilistic programming language for statistical inference written in C++. The Stan language is used to specify a (Bayesian) statistical model with an imperative program calculating the log probability density function. Stan is named in honour of Stanislaw Ulam, pioneer of the Monte Carlo method.</p>
<p>The {brms} package using the R syntax for modeling data but calls Stan for fitting. <a href="https://rdrr.io/cran/brms/man/cor_car.html" class="uri">https://rdrr.io/cran/brms/man/cor_car.html</a></p>
<p>Fit a CAR model. Create a symmetric weights matrix from the neighborhood list. Scale the variables. NOTE: I could not get this to work in RStudio Cloud.</p>
